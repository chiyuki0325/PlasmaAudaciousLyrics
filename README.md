[简体中文](/README.zh.md)

Lyrica is a simple software to show desktop lyrics on Linux focused on simplicity and integration.  
Unlike similar projects like [Waylyrics](https://github.com/waylyrics/waylyrics), it integrates with desktop environments and shows lyrics on the desktop's panels.  
Currently the project is in development, but the current version is already usable.  

The project's name comes from the Touhou Project character Lyrica Prismriver.
